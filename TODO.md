# TODO

- Gradient background transition
- Center 'slept for' and 'awake for' text and time
- Styles. Needs a lot of love.
- Nail down timepicker mode change (hrs to mins)
- More testing
- Poll the server every ?minute? so userA sees userB changes without needing to refresh.
- Sweet SVG animation. Probably pinch this [Day/Night SVG animation](https://codepen.io/trig65/pen/ExjbmEJ) to start.

## Additional features

- Display and edit list of entries for today
- Store and View historic sleep times/durations
- Display this data visually
