# TODO

- Update favicon
- Center 'slept for' and 'awake for' text and time
- Styles. Needs a lot of love.
- Nail down timepicker mode change (hrs to mins)
- More testing
- Poll the server every ?minute? so userA sees userB changes without needing to refresh.

## Additional features

- Display and edit list of entries for today
- Store and View historic sleep times/durations
- Display this data visually
- Sweet SVG animation. Probably pinch this [Day/Night SVG animation](https://codepen.io/trig65/pen/ExjbmEJ) to start.

### Done

- Deleting last entry from Firebase ✔️
- When click awake button, sleep duration freezes so we can refer to how long he slept. Same for awake too, obvi. ✔️
- Dark or light mode depending on current sleep status ✔️
