# TODO

-   Poll the server every ?minute? so userA sees userB changes without needing to refresh.
-   [Dreamhost deploy workflow?](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/216445197-Pushing-your-local-Git-repository-to-a-DreamHost-server-Linux-Mac-OS-X)
-   Sweet SVG animation. Probably pinch this [Day/Night SVG animation](https://codepen.io/trig65/pen/ExjbmEJ) to start.
